# Patterns

> **Living catalogue of how recurring problems are solved in this codebase.**
> This is different from `decisions.md` (which records *why* things were built a certain way)
> and different from conventions in CLAUDE.md (which are rules).
> This is *how* — with actual code examples from this codebase.
>
> **When to add a pattern:**
> - You solve the same class of problem for the second time
> - You spend more than 10 minutes figuring out the right way to do something
> - A code review surfaces "this should be done like X" — write X down here
>
> **When NOT to add a pattern:**
> - One-off solutions specific to a single feature
> - Things already covered by the conventions in CLAUDE.md
> - Generic programming patterns not specific to this codebase

## Cross-Feature Access

**Problem this solves:**
Feature A needs data or logic from Feature B. Without a convention, imports reach into internal files, creating tight coupling that makes both features hard to change independently.

**When to use it:**
Any time you need to access another feature's types, data, or functions from outside that feature.

**When NOT to use it:**
Within the same feature — internal imports are fine.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Each feature exposes a public API via its index/barrel file:
// src/[feature]/index.ts

// ✅ Correct — import from the public API
import { getUserById } from '@/users'

// ❌ Wrong — reaching into internal files
import { getUserById } from '@/users/services/user.service'
```

**Key things to note:**
- If the feature doesn't have an index.ts / barrel file, create one before importing
- Only export what other features actually need — keep the public surface small
- This is enforced as a convention in CLAUDE.md Section 5 (Module Boundaries)

**Example usage in this codebase:**
[Add when first cross-feature import is created]

## [Pattern Name — e.g. Paginated List Query]

**Problem this solves:**
[One sentence — what recurring situation requires this pattern]

**When to use it:**
[The specific conditions under which this pattern applies]

**When NOT to use it:**
[Any cases where this looks applicable but isn't]

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Actual code from this codebase, not pseudocode
// Copy this and adapt — don't reinvent it
[code]
```

**Key things to note:**
- [Non-obvious detail about this implementation]
- [A gotcha — something that will break if you miss it]
- [Why it's done this way rather than the obvious alternative]

**Example usage in this codebase:**
`src/[feature]/[file].ts` — [brief description of where this is used]

---

## [Pattern Name — e.g. Background Job with Retry]

**Problem this solves:**
[One sentence]

**When to use it:**
[Conditions]

**When NOT to use it:**
[Exceptions]

**Implementation:**

```typescript
[code]
```

**Key things to note:**
- [Detail]
- [Gotcha]

**Example usage in this codebase:**
`src/[feature]/[file].ts`
